Federated Meta-Learning for Emotion and Sentiment Aware Multi-modal Complaint Identification

This repository contains the dataset and code for our EMNLP 2022 paper: Federated Meta-Learning for Emotion and Sentiment Aware Multi-modal Complaint Identification

**CESAMARD Dataset**

The original CESAMARD dataset released in [Sentiment and Emotion-aware Multi-modal Complaint Identification](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21476). The CESAMARD dataset is a multimodal complaint corpus (text and images) for research in automated complaint discovery. The dataset is compiled from ecommerce webiste Amazon. CESAMARD consists of 3962 reviews with the corresponding complaint, emotion, and sentiment labels.

**MCD Dataset**

We manually annotate and extend this multi-modal CESAMARD dataset. Each record in the MCD dataset consists of the page URL, domain, image URL, review title, review text, and their corresponding annotated complaint, sentiment, and emotion labels. Another file consists of the images corresponding to the dataset records. Overall there are 4931 non-complaint reviews and 2959 complaint reviews in the dataset.
